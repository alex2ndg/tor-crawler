## Tor and the Onion Browser
Inside the Tor network, sites cannot use regular domain names. Instead, they use pseudo-domain names ending in .onion. These domain names are not registered with a central authority but are instead derived from cryptographic keys.

You can’t access these .onion sites from your normal web browser—the one you’re probably viewing this page on. Before clicking any of the links below, you’ll need to get the Tor Browser (also called the Onion Browser).

Get step-by-step instructions on how to access the dark web and use the Tor Browser.

(Note that connections inside of the Tor network are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning there is no separate encryption layer necessary as with regular websites. That’s why most onion sites do not have the S in HTTPS. Fear not; the Tor Browser will show an onion instead of the familiar lock icon when your connection is secure.)A
